Project One - Business Requirements Document
Project Two - Systems Design Document


    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
      DriverPass was started by a small business run by Liam. Liam wanted to offer people a way to study and take practice tests for the 
      DMV License exam. The written portion was to be offered in a online class format with practice tests, notes, ability to study offline
      and schedule practice driving lessons with an instructor. 
    
    What did you do particularly well?
      I think what I did particularly well was read the interview about the requirements and put it in a UML format. I believe I fulfilled the 
      owners wants and needs with the first development cycle by listing all their requirements correctly. And making sure that all the people 
      involved from the student to the staff had the proper place in the program.
      
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
      If I could choose one document to revise, it would be the activitys document due to me not being sure how properly I did it. The class 
      diagram would be my other choose and placing the correct attributes and methods in the correct places between the parent user and the 
      child student, staff, secretary, and boss classes.
      
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
      I was able to interpret the user's needs by first going over the transcript of the interview througly. Understanding that the data that would needed to 
      be available for the staff to work the student was essantial requiremtn. Example, the student driver would need to have their address, phone number, debit 
      card info, etc. for the staff to set up proper appoinments and pick up times. But understanding that this was information needed by the staff, the staff didnt
      need most of this information stored for themselves.
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
      With more practice, communication, and integrity to make sure the proper job is done will be successful in designing a system. The speed will come
      with time, and having more experienced developers will help fix mistakes that were created.
